Explanation of the four notebooks.

Three of the notebooks correspond to the three models we developed:
- Random Forest - Puja
- SVM - Dale
- CNN - Spencer

The fourth notebook was used to extract the raw data packets from the .PCAP files
into .csv files that would later be read into by the CNN notebook
